# TODO For Production Quality Carousel:

- **CMS & CDN for Images**: Implement a CMS and CDN to allow for easy content management and faster load times.

- **Add ARIA attributes and roles**: Improve the carousel's accessibility by adding ARIA attributes and roles to make it more usable for people using assistive technologies like screen readers.

- **Optimize images**: Ensure that images used in the carousel are optimized for the web to reduce load times and improve performance. Use responsive images by providing multiple sizes using the srcset attribute and proper image formats like WebP.

- **Touch controls**: Implement touch controls for mobile devices, allowing users to swipe left or right to navigate through the carousel. 

- **Lazy-loading**: Implement lazy-loading for the images in the carousel, so they only load when they are about to be displayed. This can improve performance, especially for carousels with many images.

- **Prevent content shifting**: Use a placeholder with a fixed aspect ratio to prevent content shifting when images are still loading.

- **Minification**: Minify the CSS and JavaScript files to reduce file sizes and improve load times.

- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Test the carousel across different browsers and devices to ensure a consistent experience

- **Testing**: Write unit tests to ensure that the carousel works as expected.

- **Modularization**: Break the carousel into smaller, reusable components to make it easier to maintain and extend.
